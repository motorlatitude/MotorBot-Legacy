        This library is not available as a npm module yet as it is still under active development.

<p>
    DiscordClient library requires the node-opus module to run, as such it will require ffmpeg to be installed on your system if you are interested in using the voice channel functionality. If however you're not interested in using the voice chat capabilities this can be ignored.

<p>
    If using the voice chat recording feature keep in mind that audio is currently saved in raw PCM audio format for each user, these files can get pretty big in a short amount of time, so please make sure you have enough storage space available to accomodate for this,
