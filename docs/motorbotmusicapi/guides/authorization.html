    To allow the developers to have access to the end users MotorBot data after they have signed in and accepted to share this data.
</p>
<h2>Obtaining Authorization</h2>
<p>
    In order to achieve access to a users data, it is required to first authenticate. OAuth allows for the end user to authenticate using their credentials,
    but in order to not share passwords with an app the app will be required to receive an additional <code>access_token</code> in order to access the
    end users confidential information. As per the OAuth standard (<span class="link" onclick="window.location.href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749'">RFC-6749</span>)
    3 parties are required to achieve this authorization.
</p>
<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Server</b>: This will be the MotorBot server</li>
        <li><b>Client</b>: Your application</li>
        <li><b>Resource Owner</b>: This is the end users data and controls</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Authorization Flow</h2>
<p>
    This section describes the steps to undertake in order to obtain an <code>access_token</code> and access data and controls provided by the end user. Due to the nature of this
    authorization flow, it is required to use your <code>client_secret</code>, this approach is not suitable for public facing applications such as user-agent-based applications. Special
    care should also be taken when using in native applications. This method is primarily suited for use in server based web applications.
</p>
<p>
    For further information consult <span class="link" onclick="window.location.href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749'">RFC-6749</span>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Client</b><br/>
    The client is required to have a system in place to allow a web based prompt to open should the resource owner wish to grant the client access to their data or controls.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Resource Owner</b><br/>
    The resource owner is required to sign in via a web based prompt to share their data and control access.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Server</b><br/>
    The server will return an <code>access_token</code> and a <code>refresh_token</code> on successful authorization of the resource owner.
</p>

<h4>1. Request Authorization</h4>
<p>
    The application should send a request to the MotorBot server to initiate the authorization flow. The application can achieve
    this through different strategies such as a button requesting the user to authenticate or as part of the initialisation process
    of your application.<br/><br/>
    <i>Sample Request</i>
</p>
<div class="inline-code">
    <pre class="https"><code class="https">GET https://motorbot.io/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2callback&state=q1sSxVFZMOBy0IC2KAKAb7NC&client_id=7c2816209934528ca226576f4gdfhhd4ej HTTP/1.1</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    This request allows the user to authenticate themself and agree to share information with your application.
    <br/><br/>
    Once the user has completed the sign in procedure they will return back to your application via the provided <code>redirect_uri</code>. The url will contain a temporary <code>authorization_code</code> as a query parameter which can be used to
    request an <code>access_token</code>. If a <code>state</code> is passed in the original request, this will also be returned as an additional query parameter.
    <br/><br/>
    Details regarding request parameters and response formats can be further explored in the <span class="link" onclick="loadView('endpoints/oauth2')">OAuth 2.0</span> endpoint section in these docs, specifically this initial
    request uses the <code>/oauth2/authorize</code> <span class="link" onclick="loadView('endpoints/oauth2/authorize')">endpoint</span>.
</p>
<h4>2. Request Access Token</h4>
<p>
    Once you have received the temporary <code>authorization_code</code> it should be exchanged for an <code>access_token</code> within 10 minutes. This should occur
    in the background of your application once the user has been returned to your <code>redirect_uri</code>.<br/><br/>
    <i>Sample Request</i>
</p>
<div class="inline-code">
    <pre class="https"><code class="https hljs">POST /api/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: motorbot.io
Authorization: Basic c2tqZGhmNDN1NWhpdWhoM3VpaGdka2doNDUzOml1c2hmaXVlemd0Nzg0MzU2Z2RmZw==
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 242

{
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "redirect_uri": "https://example.com/callback",
  "code": "f859b07f86c06efc2ec1f120321115299e7f49d9dda6d6e654da46543c6a228a00a216d0dfb1f513197c01624c4044437dc03f1c83687fdad840ce5abe1b89b3"
}
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    The server will return an <code>access_token</code> and a <code>refresh_token</code>. The <code>access_token</code> will typically be valid for
    24 hours after which the <code>refresh_token</code> should be used to receive a new <code>access_token</code>.
    <br/><br/>
    Further information on the request parameters and response format can be found in the <span class="link" onclick="loadView('endpoints/oauth2')">OAuth 2.0</span> endpoint section in these docs. To receive an access and refresh token
    the <code>/oauth2/token</code> <span class="link" onclick="loadView('endpoints/oauth2/token')">endpoint</span> should be used.
</p>
<h4>3. Request Restricted Data from the Resource Owner</h4>
<p>
    Your app now should have an <code>access_token</code> which can be used to return user specific data or control certain actions on behalf of the user. The <code>access_token</code>
    should be supplied as part of an <code>Authorization</code> request header.
    <br/><br/>
    <i>Sample Request</i>
</p>
<div class="inline-code">
    <pre class="https"><code class="https hljs">GET /api/user/me?api_key=uierih-hf4378rtg-ert34t-34564 HTTP/1.1
Host: motorbot.io
Authorization: Bearer f859b07f86c06efc2ec1f120321115299e7f49d9dda6d6e654da46543c6a228a00a216d0dfb1f513197c01624c4044437dc03f1c83687fdad840ce5abe1b89b3
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    If the request is successful a successful response status code should be received such as <code>200</code> <b>OK</b>. These can be further explored in the
    available endpoints that are part of this API. Should the request be unsuccessful due to an authorization error, a <code>401</code> <b>Unauthorized</b> response
    status code is sent. This can represent a couple of issues;
</p>
<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>It could indicate that the request was missing an <code>api_key</code>, or that the supplied <code>api_key</code> is invalid.</li>
        <li>Secondly it could also indicate that the authorization header was incorrectly formatted or the supplied <code>access_token</code> is invalid. Additionally,
        it should be noted that should the <code>access_token</code> have expired, this will also result in a <code>401</code> <b>Unauthorized</b> error, in this case the
        current <code>access_token</code> should be renewed by using the previously supplied <code>refresh_token</code>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<h4>4. Renew Access Token from Refresh Token</h4>
<p>
    Received access tokens are designed to expire after 24 hours after which the client should renew their <code>access_token</code> by using the <code>refresh_token</code>
    originally obtained from the <code>authorization_code</code> exchange.
    <br/><br/>
